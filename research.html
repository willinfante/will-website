      <b>10-15-2023    Financial Crisis Correlation in Russia</b>
      <a href="/rus-finc.html">Link</a>
      <p>Search historical stock data to find a historical trend closeset to the bubble during 2005-2007 in the Russian stock market. 
      Will likely be expanded soon to include multiple countries as cross references(US, UK, RUS, etc.) to predict future stock prices
      given the magnitude of current trends. Using Python, I was able to scan through roughly 600 sections of past stock prices and utilize
      compare each to the period Jan-2005 - Dec 2007 utilizing euclidean distance. I programmed it to compare each of those sections to
      the current period and return whichever combination of the two were the three shortest euclidean distances, with surprising results. 
      The program returned the period August 1866 through June 1869 to closest to the current period.</p>
      <img src="chart.png" alt="chart" width=100% height="350">
      <p>In Russian history, there was a recession in 1870-1871, as reflected in the chart which falls at the same time as the 2008-2009 recession
      happened. In retrospect, given this model in June 2007, with the fed funds rate 5.25%, it would have been wise to short the market. While this
      is easily said in hindsight, if one had done a thorough analysis and seen this, along with seeing how much 'gas was left in the tank' of the bubble,
      one could have probably determined around when the market would have reversed. Another inicator I will work on soon is one in which a long term
      trend line is extrapolated across the S&P 500, recording the highest and lowest std. deviations in the set while comparing that to the std.
      deviation of the present. A model like this combined with an analysis of the strength in inputs driving the ups and downs of the market
        would be helpful in projected future market movements. </p>

      <p> Compares Union Pacific to its primary competitors and looks at their financial results during previous downturns to 
        see if they can endure future downturns. I take a look at the financials of UNP itself and see if it is suitable for investment.

      <b>7-26-2023     Prudential Financial</b>
      <a href="/Prudential Financial Report.pdf">Link</a>
      <p>This is some research I did over the quarantine along with JP Morgan, Union Pacfic, Disney, and a variety of others.
        This research is not very relevant today as conditions have changed and everything would have to be analyzed again,
        but this just shows you the kind of research I do.  Will post more of these and more recent research in the future.
