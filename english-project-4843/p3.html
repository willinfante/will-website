                <b>Casablanca (1942)</b> <br>
                Taking place and being filmed during the Second World War, this film captures the life of Rick Blaine, a
                cynical refugee from France, who owns
                a cafe in Casablanca, Morroco. He is very neutral about the war and has not interest in being apart of
                the resistance. He is famous for saying,
                'I stick my neck out for nobody'. Shortly into the movie he reunites with his lover (who is married to a
                member of the resistance) whom abandoned
                him in Paris, and the reason for his cynicality. Rick soon has to decide whether to escape with her to
                America, or to let her go with her husband
                who by leaving will help the Allies win the war. Ultimately, as we will see, he does the right thing for
                society and lets go of his selfishness.

                Casablanca teaches us to not be individualistic. Early on in the movie, Rick frequently says, "I stick
                my neck out for nobody".
                When questioned by the Germans, he remains neutral towards the war, not caring who won. However, this
                changes quickly at the
                end of the movie. Rather than escape with Isla (which would have been selfish of him), he decides to
                help her and her husband
                escape. In doing so he ends up fighting for the Allies, since her husband is a key member of the
                Resistance. Ultimatley, the
                movie teaches us the value of collectivism towards a common good. Also at the end, we hear Rick say,
                "... I think this is the
                start of a beautiful friendship" to Louie. This also teaches us the value of social connections and
                shows us that even through
                things didn't work out as Rick had planned, he's still ok.

        <!--This next film was released in 1946, starring Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey. The movie starts with a
                flash-forward of everyone praying for George. It then goes to the perspective of God showing one of his
                angels (Clarence) through George's life, as George was considering 'giving up God's greatest gift'. The
                movie starts at a young age and goes all the way up to the night of when he was going through trouble,
                and teaching many lessons along the way. 
            
            
                            • It's a Wonderful Life emphasizes how we can impact others lives in a positive way (not just our own).
                The movie emphasizes friendship and community. <BR>
                • Clarence's final message is about friendship: 'Remember no man is a failure who has friends.' "

                <p style="font-size:2.1vw;">
                    The film begins by listening to different peoples prayers for George from around Bedford Falls. In
                    response to all the concerned prayers,
                    a conversation between God, Joseph, and George's Guardian Angel, Clarence ensues. God tells
                    Clarence that George will be seriously
                    considering throwing away His greatest gift (life). To help Clarence understand why George is in
                    This
                    condition, he shows him a 'rewind' of George's life since he was a little boy.
                    George begins life with high aspirations of going out exploring and building great things. However,
                    as he gets older this catches up to him when he realizes he has responsibilities in Bedford falls.
                    After
                    his father passes away, he takes over his position as President of the Bailey Building and Loan
                    instead of going
                    off to college. Despite also being married, he becomes discontent with the lack of opulence in his
                    life.
                    This crecendos when his uncle (who works at the bank with him) loses all of the banks cash. This is
                    when God's replay ends and
                    Clarence is sent down to save George. Clarence teaches George the value of his life by
                    showing him what the world would have been
                    life without him (which would be a disaster). George then returns to his life happy, knowing that he
                    has lots of friends and has had a positive
                    impact on all of them. All along George learns that he has been focused on the wrong things.

                Media has changed over the past 100 years and with it values of America have changed. Some of these
                values include, but are not limited to: social connections, materialism, perfectionism, and general 
                positivity. It seems that these changing values (less emphasis on others, more materialism, more 
                perfectionism, and less general positivity) as reflected in the media today
                have perpetuated the mental health crisis that we see in America today. If people could pay
                more attention to what their values are and what they believe in, perhaps the crisis would 
                get better compared to where we are today.
